# Directives

SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) written in Markdown.

Each directive defines:
- **Goals** - What we're trying to accomplish
- **Inputs** - What data/parameters are needed
- **Tools/Scripts** - Which execution scripts to use
- **Outputs** - Expected deliverables
- **Edge cases** - Known issues and how to handle them

Directives are living documents—update them as you learn.
