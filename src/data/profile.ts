  bio: "I love building things that help people make better decisions with data. Whether it's an alerting platform that catches issues before they cascade, an LLM workflow that saves hours of manual work, or a pipeline that finally makes messy data usable—I'm drawn to problems where the right system can change how a team operates. I've had the chance to build these kinds of solutions at Audax and General Atlantic, and I'm currently finishing my Data Science & Business Administration degree at Northeastern (Honors).",
